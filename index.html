    <p> Steve Jobs was born on 24th February 1955 in Silicon Valley, San Francisco. His parents were Abdulfattah Jandali and22qa Joanne Simpson, He dropped out of Reed College in Portland, Oregen and got a job in Atari Corporation. <br> He reconnected with his High School friend named Stephen Wozniak (Jerry). After Jerry dropped out of HP, they both founded a startup called Apple in Steve's Garage and made a computer called <b> "The Apple â… ". </b> Steve Jobs was very innovative at the time, but he didn't have enough resources to make those innovative ideas. So they decided that they would go step by step until they had good graphics and good shape for creating computers/laptops. During the 1970s-1991s (During the Cold War) Steve went to India to experience Bhuddism, Steve Jobs and Jerry Wozniak started working on the <b> "The Apple II" </b> , <b> "The Lisa" </b> and the <b> "The Macintosh". </b> Then, He got Kicked out of Apple. He asked himself "How can the board fire the founder of a company?". He got kicked out of Apple because the board had agreed on a new founder. Then, He started neXT and Pixar and aquired his position back in his hands. The 20th Century arrived, Apple was earning money and new products were get produced. The iMac had just been made. Pixar has been discussing plans for more animated movies. Also Later on, The first Pods were introduced. These pods were connected with wires to a small radio/music box. during the 2000s-2008s, Jobs had plans for the first iPad.
